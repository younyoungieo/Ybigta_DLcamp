TODO 3-1: The BaseCommand class has a show_usage method implemented, but the execute method is not 
implemented and is passed on to the child class. Think about why this difference is made.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
The show_usage method is implemented in the BaseCommand class to provide a default behavior 
for displaying the usage information of a command. This behavior can be inherited and used 
by all subclasses without the need for individual implementations. On the other hand, the execute method 
is left unimplemented in the BaseCommand class because each command subclass is expected to have 
its own unique implementation of the execution logic. By leaving it unimplemented, the BaseCommand class 
enforces that each subclass must override the execute method and provide its own implementation.


TODO 3-2: The update_current_path method of the BaseCommand class is slightly different from other methods. 
It has a @classmethod decorator and takes a cls argument instead of self. In Python, this is called a 
class method, and think about why it was implemented as a class method instead of a normal method.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English): 
It is because it operates on the class itself rather than on an instance of the class. Since the current path 
is a shared value among all instances of the BaseCommand class, the update_current_path method should directly 
access the class_variable.
